Enabling I2c device in Raspberry Pi. Pi is ready to go with I2C as far as enabling the hardware goes. You will need to open LX Terminal and enter the following command:

sudo nano /etc/modules

And add these two lines to the end of the file:

    i2c-bcm2708
    i2c-dev


Depending on your distribution, you may also have to edit a file which comes under

sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf 

blacklist spi-bcm2708
blacklist i2c-bcm2708

Edit and comment the above two lines by putting a “#” infront of them

#blacklist spi-bcm2708
#blacklist i2c-bcm2708
